# Assignment 1: C# and Unit tests

* Create a "Class Library (.NET core)" project.
* Create a class *Book* with properties (note the different constraints):
    * Title, minimum 2 characters long
    * Author
    * Page number, 10 < pagenumber <= 1000
    * Isbn13, must be a text string of exactly 13 characters.

    If the above constraints are not complied with, appropriate exceptions must be thrown. This also applies to constructors.
* Add a unit test to your project. Test your Book class. Your test test should have a good "Code Coverage".
